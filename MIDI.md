What does MIDI stand for?

* MIDI stands for *MUSICAL INSTRUMENT DIGITAL INTERFACE*.

How does MIDI work?
*  No audio signals are sent via MIDI. Instead MIDI works as digital signal. A series of binary digits (0s and 1s).
* Each instrument understands ans then responds to these 1s and 0s, which are combined into 8-bit messages supporting data rates of up to 31,250 bits per second.
* These messages can communicate info such as:
	* which note is pressed.
	* the moment note is pressed and released.
	* the velocity (how hard it is pressed)
	* after touch (which key pressure changes)
	* vibrato, and even
	* pitch bend
* MIDI protocol can support up to 128 notes, ranging from C five octaves below middle C up to G ten octaves higher.

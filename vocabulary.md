This function, time_cutter, encodes a time duration (such as in MIDI event processing) into a sequence of discrete time-shift tokens, using a strategy recommended by Oore et al. (2018) for music modeling.

Core Idea:

Rather than representing every possible millisecond value as a unique token, which would make the vocabulary huge, it "cuts" any time duration into a sequence of standardized, limited-size time-shift tokens. This allows efficient encoding and decoding of arbitrary time gaps between events.

How the Function Works
1. Parameters

    time: The total time interval in milliseconds (between MIDI events) that needs to be encoded.

    lth (LTH): The maximum time shift value allowed for a single token.

    div (DIV): The granularity, i.e., how many ms per time-shift token. The number of possible time-shift tokens is lth // div.

2. Segmentation Strategy

It expresses time as:
time=k×max_time_shift+leftover_time_shift
time=k×max_time_shift+leftover_time_shift

Where:

    k=time//max_time_shiftk=time//max_time_shift → Number of times the biggest time-shift token fits into time.

    leftover_time_shift=time%max_time_shiftleftover_time_shift=time%max_time_shift → Remaining time, expressed as an additional token if needed.

3. Tokenization

    Each time-shift is expressed as an event index: e.g., 30ms, 60ms, etc.

    The function adds k tokens for the largest allowed shift, then possibly one more token for the leftover.

    The custom rounding, round_, ensures consistent rounding of values (especially those ending in .5 go upward).

4. Returns

    time_shifts: A list of time-shift event indices. Each index refers to a token in the vocabulary letting the model learn time intervals without needing a huge vocabulary or continuous values.

Example

Suppose:

    time = 250 ms

    lth = 100 ms (max shift for a single token)

    div = 10 ms (token quantization)
    So, max token shift index = lth / div = 10 (each token=10ms)

Then:

    k=250//100=2 → two tokens of maximum shift
    leftover = 250%100=50 → one token for 50ms

Using rounding, the function would output:

    `` (where 10=100ms token, 5=50ms token)

Why This Matters

    Reduces model vocabulary size by quantizing time intervals.

    Allows arbitrary timing representation by combining a fixed set of tokens.

    Makes training sequence models for music efficient and practical.
The round_ Helper

    Custom logic: Any .5 fraction is rounded up, not down.

    For example, round_(3.5) yields 4, always rounding .5 "up."
